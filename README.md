Stellar evolution describes the life cycle of stars, from their formation to their eventual demise. Understanding this process is crucial for astrophysics, as it influences the structure and dynamics of galaxies, the distribution of elements, and the formation of planetary systems. This project integrates concepts from fractal geometry, loop quantum gravity, and centrifugal effects to provide a novel perspective on stellar evolution.
