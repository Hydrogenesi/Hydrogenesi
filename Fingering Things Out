derivations 
Derivation
The gravitational force acting on a shell of mass dmdm at a radius rr is given by:
dFg=−GM(r)dmr2dF_g = -\frac{G M(r) dm}{r^2}
where GG is the gravitational constant, M(r)M(r) is the mass enclosed within radius rr, and dmdm is the mass of the shell.
The pressure gradient dPdP provides the outward force:
dFp=−dP⋅AdF_p = -dP \cdot A
where AA is the surface area of the shell.
For a spherical shell, A=4πr2A = 4 \pi r^2, and the mass of the shell dmdm is:
dm=ρ⋅dV=ρ⋅4πr2drdm = \rho \cdot dV = \rho \cdot 4 \pi r^2 dr
Equating the forces dFgdF_g and dFpdF_p:
−GM(r)ρ⋅4πr2drr2=−dP⋅4πr2-\frac{G M(r) \rho \cdot 4 \pi r^2 dr}{r^2} = -dP \cdot 4 \pi r^2
Simplifying, we get the hydrostatic equilibrium equation:
dPdr=−ρGM(r)r2\frac{dP}{dr} = -\rho \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}
2. Energy Generation
Energy generation in stars primarily occurs through nuclear fusion processes, such as the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle.
Proton-Proton Chain
The energy generation rate per unit mass for the proton-proton chain reaction is given by:
ϵpp=1.07×10−7(ρ105)(T107)4\epsilon_{pp} = 1.07 \times 10^{-7} \left( \frac{\rho}{10^5} \right) \left( \frac{T}{10^7} \right)^4
where ϵpp\epsilon_{pp} is the energy generation rate, ρ\rho is the density, and TT is the temperature.
CNO Cycle
The energy generation rate per unit mass for the CNO cycle is given by:
ϵCNO=8.24×10−26(ρ105)(T107)19\epsilon_{CNO} = 8.24 \times 10^{-26} \left( \frac{\rho}{10^5} \right) \left( \frac{T}{10^7} \right)^{19}
3. Radiative Transfer
Radiative transfer describes the transport of energy through radiation in a star.
Derivation
The temperature gradient due to radiative energy transport is given by:
dTdr=−3κρL16πaradiationcT3r2\frac{dT}{dr} = -\frac{3 \kappa \rho L}{16 \pi a_radiation c T^3 r^2}
where κ\kappa is the opacity, ρ\rho is the density, LL is the luminosity, aradiationa_radiation is the radiation constant, cc is the speed of light, TT is the temperature, and rr is the radius.
4. Equations of State
The equation of state for an ideal gas is given by:
P=ρμRgasTP = \frac{\rho}{\mu} R_gas T
where PP is the pressure, ρ\rho is the density, μ\mu is the mean molecular weight, RgasR_gas is the universal gas constant, and TT is the temperature.
5. Mass Continuity Equation
The mass continuity equation describes the change in mass with respect to radius:
dMdr=4πr2ρ\frac{dM}{dr} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho
6. Opacity
Opacity κ\kappa at a given density and temperature using Kramers' Law is given by:
κ=κ0(ρ105)T−3.5\kappa = \kappa_0 \left( \frac{\rho}{10^5} \right) T^{-3.5}
where κ0\kappa_0 is a constant.
7. Stellar Evolution Timescales
The main sequence lifetime of a star based on its mass and luminosity is given by:
τMS=EtotalL=M⋅0.007⋅c2L\tau_{MS} = \frac{E_{total}}{L} = \frac{M \cdot 0.007 \cdot c^2}{L}
where τMS\tau_{MS} is the main sequence lifetime, EtotalE_{total} is the total nuclear energy available, MM is the mass of the star, and LL is the luminosity.
These derivations provide a comprehensive understanding of the key equations used in the stellar evolution model. If you have any specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

In fractal spacetime, the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is modified to account for fractal dimensions:
dPdr=−ρGM(r)rD−1\frac{dP}{dr} = -\rho \frac{G M(r)}{r^{D - 1}}
Where DD represents the fractal dimension.
4.1.2 Mass Continuity Equation
The mass continuity equation in fractal dimensions is given by:
dMdr=SD(r)ρ\frac{dM}{dr} = S_D(r) \rho
Where SD(r)S_D(r) represents a generalized surface area in fractal dimensions.
